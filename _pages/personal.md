I am an obsessive Manchester United fan. I have been following the club since they won the treble in 1999. My favourite player is [Roy Keane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Keane). When I am not occupied 
with Manchester United, I enjoy hiking, cooking traditional Bengali food and recently have started birding with my wife. Like thousands of other 
Indians I trained to be a professional cricket player during my childhood. However, my career high point in cricket came on the day when I played in
the [Eden Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Gardens) in a scorching May afternoon in Kolkata.

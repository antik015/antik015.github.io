Hello there! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Detaprtment of Statistics](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). Prior to this I was a Postdoctoral Associate at the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.stat.duke.edu/), [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/) where I worked with [Prof. David Dunson](https://stat.duke.edu/people/david-b-dunson) on Bayesian statistical methods with a special focus on binary or count data types. My current research is motivated from high-dimensional species/event occurrence data where I frequently collaborate with [Prof. Otso Ovaskainen](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/otso-ovaskainen) and his group. A major focus of my research is to develop computationally scalable solutions for traditional Bayesian methods so that they can be applied to very high-dimensional/big data sets. Before coming to Duke, I was at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/) where I obtained my PhD under joint supervision of [Prof. Bani K. Mallick](http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~bmallick/) and [Prof. Anirban Bhattacharya](https://www.stat.tamu.edu/~anirbanb/) from the [Department of Statistics.](https://www.stat.tamu.edu/). In my thesis I worked on various computational, theoretical and methodological aspects of Bayesian shrinkage priors.

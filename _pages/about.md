I am a Postdoctoral associate at the Department of Statistical Sciences, Duke University since August, 2018. I work with [Prof. David Dunson](https://stat.duke.edu/people/david-b-dunson) on Bayesian statistical methods with a special focus on binary or count data types. My current research is motivated from high-dimensional species/event occurrence data where I frequently collaborate with [Prof. Otso Ovaskainen](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/otso-ovaskainen) and his team. I am also interested in building scalable Bayesian nonparametric methods for classical statistical problems such as density estimation. Before coming to Duke, I was at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/) where I obtained my PhD under joint supervision of [Prof. Bani K. Mallick](http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~bmallick/) and [Prof. Anirban Bhattacharya](https://www.stat.tamu.edu/~anirbanb/) from the [Department of Statistics.](https://www.stat.tamu.edu/). In my thesis I worked on various computational, theoretical and methodological aspects of Bayesian shrinkage priors.

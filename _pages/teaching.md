* STAT 633 at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/): Gave 6 lectures for the Advanced Bayesian methods course intednded for PhD 
students. Topics covered were posterior consistency, posterior contraction in high dimensional or nonparametric Bayesian methods. I prepared a semi-formal set of [notes](https://antik015.github.io/files/bayes_rates.pdf) based on the topics covered. These notes are mainly prepared from the book "Fundamentals of Bayesian nonparametrics" by Ghosal and Van der Vaart. You can 
access the book in a series of lectures [here](http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~avdvaart/BNP/BNP.pdf). My notes mainly covers parts of Chapters 7, 8 and 9.
